      <p>
        This project is primarily a personal/experimental site, but if you’d like to
        get in touch about the code, the data, or related projects, you can:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Reach out by email (once you add it here).</li>
        <li>Link to a GitHub repository with the project code.</li>
        <li>Add a contact form on this page in the future.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For now, this page is a placeholder showing where contact information or a
        form will live.
      </p>
