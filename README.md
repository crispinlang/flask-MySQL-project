# ViralQueryX

## Overview

This project implements a full-stack web application for querying and exploring a relational biological database.  
The backend is built using Flask and connects to a previously created MySQL database containing viral metadata, genome sequences, protein sequences, and enzyme annotations.

In addition to the web interface, the application exposes a RESTful API that allows database queries to be executed directly via URL parameters and returned in JSON format. This enables both interactive use through a browser and programmatic access for external tools or scripts.

---

## Functionality

The application provides the following core features:

- A unified search interface for querying multiple database tables simultaneously
- Grouped display of search results by table
- Automatic truncation of long biological sequences with expandable “show more / show less” functionality
- Clickable search results that link to a detailed table view
- A RESTful API endpoint for retrieving query results as JSON
- Consistent, reusable page layout and styling across the application
- Configuration via environment variables to support local development and cloud deployment

## RESTful API Usage

The REST API allows direct access to query results without using the web interface.

Example request:

```text
{
  "query": "coronavirus",
  "results": [
    {
      "table": "virus",
      "rows": [
        {
          "virus_id": 1,
          "virus_name": "SARS-CoV-2",
          "family_name": "Coronaviridae"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This API can be consumed by:
- Python scripts
- Data analysis pipelines
- External applications

## Website visuals

### Landing page
![Landing page](img/landing.png)
- Landing page allows for direct navigation to search or table page.

### Search interface
![Search page](img/search.png)
- Search query with two premade searches available via buttons

### Tables page
![Search page](img/tables.png)
- Showcasing the clickable hyperlinks to be able to navigate directly to the NCBI entry
