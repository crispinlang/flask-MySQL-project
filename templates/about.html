      <h2>About this project</h2>
      <p>
        This website is a Flask-based web application that connects to a MySQL database
        and displays results from a previous project. It is mainly a playground for
        experimenting with web development, backend integration, and data visualization.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is to make the underlying data easier to explore through a clean,
        modern interface, while also serving as a learning environment for full-stack
        development (Python, Flask, SQL, HTML/CSS).
