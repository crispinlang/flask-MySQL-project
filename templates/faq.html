      <h3>What is this website for?</h3>
      <p>
        This site showcases results from a MySQL database using a Flask backend.
        It's mainly for experimentation and learning, and for visualizing data
        from a previous project.
      </p>

      <h3>How are the results loaded?</h3>
      <p>
        The backend uses Python and Flask to connect to a MySQL database, run SQL queries,
        and pass the results into Jinja templates which render the tables you see.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I see multiple tables?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. The results and testing pages demonstrate loading one or several tables and
        rendering them in separate styled boxes.
